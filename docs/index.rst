PyPSA-ZA: An open Optimisation Model of the South African Power System
=======================================================================

PyPSA-ZA is an open model dataset of the South African power system at three spatial resolutions namely;

- ``1-supply``: A single node for the entire South Africa.
- ``11-supply``: 11 nodes based on the `Eskom Generation Connection Capacity Assessment of the 2024 Transmission Network (GCCA â€“ 2024)  <https://www.eskom.co.za/eskom-divisions/tx/gcca/>`_ regions.
- ``27-supply``: 27 nodes based on Eskom 27 supply regions.

PyPSA-ZA is a high temporal resolution multi-horizon expansion planning model for a least cost optimised transition path to 
a decarbonised power sector over the coming decades for South Africa.

PyPSA-ZA makes use of freely available and open data which encourages the open exchange of model data developments and eases the comparison of model results. 
It provides a full, automated software pipeline to assemble the load-flow-ready model from the original datasets, which enables easy replacement and 
improvement of the individual parts.

PyPSA-ZA is designed to be imported into the open toolbox `PyPSA <https://pypsa.org/>`_ for which `documentation <https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ is available as well.

This project is currently maintained by `Meridian Economics <https://meridianeconomics.co.za/>`_. Previous versions were developed within the Energy Centre 
at the `Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) <https://www.csir.co.za/>`_ as part of the `CoNDyNet project <https://fias.institute/en/projects/condynet/>`_, which is supported by the 
`German Federal Ministry of Education and Research <https://www.bmbf.de/bmbf/en/home/home_node.html>`_ under grant no. 03SF0472C.

The model is currently under development and has been validated for the single node (`1-supply`), for more information on the capability of the moel please see the :ref:`release-notes`.
